# DO NOT USE THIS FOR YOUR OWN SAKE :)

I had to extract this from my `node_modules`, because the version I pulled into my project suddenly disappeared from the Vuex repository. That's why you should not rewrite repo history...

This is old, obsolete, deprecated, and describable by all other derogatory terms you might think of. Just go and use the main repo. Shoo. Go.
